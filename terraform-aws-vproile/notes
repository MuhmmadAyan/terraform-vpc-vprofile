1. use terraform registry to get the ready made pakages to lauch stuff on cloud. like voc etc,
2. I DevOps, you need to use the standard DevOps practice when you are using terraform. Like use version control for you iaac , use s3 to maintain the state, use proper se=ytax checking for iaac , use vars file with all the info that can be recreated later. 
3.use mysql version 5.7.337 as this is the least or oldest version in the res database selection section.
4. Since we are using the v  for mysql we will use parameter group default.mysql.5.7
5. Also use identifier to name the ads that you are creating.
6. Use db_name for creation of database I the ads instance that will get launched.
7. Use associate_public_ip_address = true in bastion host file to get rid of the host cannot be empty in bastion.tf file.
